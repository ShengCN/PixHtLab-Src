    "The ImaGen package provides comprehensive support for creating resolution-independent two-dimensional pattern distributions. ImaGen consists of a large library of spatial patterns, including mathematical functions, geometric primitives, and images read from files, along with many ways to combine or select from any other patterns. These patterns can be used in any Python program that needs configurable patterns or streams of patterns.  Basically, as long as the code can accept a Python callable and will call it each time it needs a new pattern, users can then specify any pattern possible in ImaGen's simple declarative pattern language, and the downstream code need not worry about any of the details about how the pattern is specified or generated.  This approach gives users full flexibility about which patterns they wish to use, while relieving the downstream code from having to implement anything about patterns. The detailed examples below should help make this clear.\n",

The values are \"time dependent\" (because we set them to be so above), so that any randomness changes only when the time changes, and the randomness is computed as a function of time.  That way, regardless of the order you generate the patterns, or even if you go back and forward in time, you will always get the same results at a given nominal time.  In your own code, you can turn off time dependence (``param.Dynamic.time_dependent=False``), in which case new parameter values will be generated for every call to the ``PatternGenerator``.  Or, if you are working in a domain that has a clear temporal component, such as simulation, you can set ``param.Dynamic.time_fn`` to a function based on your own nominal time, advancing it as appropriate.  You can even set that function to real time, in which case you'll get completely unpredictable randomness, which may be appropriate in some circumstances.  Whenever there is some notion of time that governs the patterns you want to see, setting ``time_dependent=True`` is a good idea, so that you have precise control over the randomness to ensure reproducible results.\n",

If you don't want the automatic scaling, rotating, etc. (e.g. for a whole-field pattern like a new type of random distribution), you can override ``self.__call__`` instead of ``self.function()``, which allows you to do anything that returns a Numpy array of the requested size.
